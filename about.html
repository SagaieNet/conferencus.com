        <div class="page-content">
            <p>After going to many conferences, user groups and events we realized something. A lot of great content gets produced that will never see the outside world. While you can find slides online, they tend to be just a collection of images. No context and no external sources like code examples. We want to make the experience better.</p>

            <p>Even more so, it is our goal to make conferences accessible and affordable to everyone. By publishing it all online, even the people who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford the flight can access it. Submerging themselves into the latest and greatest technologies, ideas and projects. With online education starting to take off conferences shouldn't be far behind either.</p>

            <p>What we are building here is a place which will soon offer a conference experience without ever flying to one. Starting with a great experience for watching slides, even if you are on your phone. We still think you should go to as many as you can. But if you can't or just don't want to you should still be able to see the talks.</p>

            <p>And as a speaker or conference organizer, the talk you produce will be able to reach even more people. Expanding your audience beyond the hundreds which fit in your class. Furthermore, if you are looking to travel and speak to even more places, a great portfolio of talks will help you find them.</p>

            <p>This is just a start, help us build the new conferences' experience.</p>
